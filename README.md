# An attempt at generating poems using Markov Chains

For the English poems, I used books tagged with "poetry" from Project Gutenberg. Download the `ndjson` file from http://static.decontextualize.com/gutenberg-poetry-v001.ndjson.gz and run `gutenberg-scraper.py` to extract the different poems.

For the Norwegian poems, I used Henrik Wergeland's poem collections found at https://dikt.org. Run `scraper.py` if you want to use them as well.
